Christmas on the
Island of Sodor!
Plow, Thomas, plow!

It is time
for the Christmas fair.
Who will play Santa?

Sir Topham Hatt!

Santa needs a sled.

Workers hammer.
Painters paint.

Winston does not
look like a sled.

Thomas picks up
a real sled.

Uh-oh! Ice!
Thomas goes slow.

Peep, peep!
The sled is safe.

Where is Santa?

Ho, ho, ho!

Santa is ready.
Thomas backs up.

Watch out,
Thomas!

Oh, no!
He bumps the sled!

Thomas will save Santa.
Hurry, Thomas!

Look out
for branches!

Peep, peep!
Ho, ho, ho!
Thomas pulls
Santa’s sled.

Merry Christmas!

Clack-clack!

Bertie drives on roads.

Thomas pulls Annie
and Clarabel.
“Go fast!” they call.
“Go faster!”

“Bertie is in front,”
says Annie.
“Bertie is in front,”
says Clarabel.

“Wait and see,” Thomas
tells them.

The road crosses
the tracks.
Bertie has to stop.

“Good-bye, Bertie,”
Thomas calls.

Now Thomas is in front.

But Thomas has to stop
to let the people off.

Bertie catches up!
“Good-bye, Thomas,”
Bertie says.
Now Bertie is in front.

“Go fast,” says Annie.
“Go faster,” says Clarabel.
“Wait and see,” Thomas
tells them.

A hill is up ahead.

through the hill.

“Peep, peep,”
says Thomas.
“Yes, it was.”
