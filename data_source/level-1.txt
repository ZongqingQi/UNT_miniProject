“These shoes are cool,” said Nick.
“But as you can see,
they may fit your dad
but they’re too big for me.”

“When I wear my mom’s shoes,”
said Sally, “I fall.
Her shoes are too big
and my feet are too small.”

“Shoe trouble?” the Cat said.
“Well, I have some news.
Not everyone’s feet can
fit in the same shoes.

“Feet come in all sizes,
and soon you’ll see that
some are flippy, some flappy,
and some feet are flat.

“Want to see some neat feet?
Well, today I’ll take you
to a faraway place:
Bing-Bungle-Ba-Boo!

“It’s a wonderful place
full of friends you will meet.
And each of them has,
oh, such different feet!”

In minutes they landed
in Bing-Bungle-Ba-Boo,
right by a lake,
and the Cat called, “Yoo-hoo!”

“Hello there, Cat! Welcome
to my lake,” said a duck.
“Emily!” cried the Cat.
“There you are! We’re in luck!

“Meet Emily, one of
my friends,” said the Cat.
“As you see, her two feet
are all flippy and flat.”

“It’s true,” said the duck.
“My feet are long and wide.
Let’s swim and I’ll race you
to the other side.”

The kids tried their best,
but soon Sally said,
“We’ve fallen behind.
Emily’s way ahead!”

“She won,” said the Cat,
“and we came in last.
Her feet push the water
so she can swim fast.

“Duck feet are perfect
for swimming, it’s true.
With my Flipper-ma-zippers
we can swim fast, too.”

They swam really fast
and crossed the finish line.
Then they heard a voice call,
“Do you have feet like mine?”

“Nick and Sally,” the Cat said,
“I’d like you to meet
Mikey the Lemur,
who hangs by his feet.”

“Our feet aren’t like yours,”
said Nick. “Not at all.
If we hung by our feet,
I’m afraid we would fall.”

“I have lemur feet,”
said the Cat, “just for you.
Now you can hang
the way Mikey can do.”

Before the kids knew it,
they were up in a tree.
“I can hang like a lemur,”
said Nick. “Look at me!”

“Try this!” Mikey said.
“You will think that it’s neat.
You can hang upside down
just by using your feet.”

“Lemurs are great climbers,”
a voice said, “but see?
Nobody is better
at climbing than me!”

“Greg the Gecko!” the Cat said.
“We’re glad to see you.
Geckos have feet
that can stick just like glue.”

“Tiny hairs,” said Greg,
“help my feet to grip.
These hairs let me hold on
so I do not slip.”

The Cat passed out gecko feet.
Nick said, “This is tricky.
I can’t move at all.
My feet are too sticky.”

“Look!” said the gecko.
“I’ll show you my trick—
press and peel, peel and press,
and your feet will not stick.”

They pressed and they peeled,
and the gecko was right.
They walked upside down,
and their feet held on tight.

“I can walk like a gecko!”
said Nick. “Who would guess
you can walk upside down
if you peel and you press?

“Try duck feet for swimming,
and lemurs’ for gripping.
The feet of a gecko
will keep you from slipping.

“But, Sally, I think that
when we get back home,
I’ll return your dad’s shoes
and just wear . . .

“. . . my own!”

Squeak! Squeak!
Is that the sound
of a baby dinosaur
calling to its mother?

Nobody knows.
Nobody has ever heard
a baby dinosaur.
Nobody has seen one.
The age of the dinosaurs
ended millions of years ago.
But we know a lot
about them from what
dinosaur hunters have
found. . . .


They have found small
baby bones in nests.

They have even found
dinosaur eggs.
Many dinosaurs were very big.
But their eggs were small.

The smallest was only
as big as a quarter.

The biggest was about
the size of a football!


Were dinosaurs good mothers?
This kind of dinosaur was.
She made a nest of mud
and laid her eggs in it.
Chickens sit on their eggs.

But this dinosaur did not.
She was too heavy.
The eggs would break!
She put leaves on the eggs
to keep them warm.

The mother watched the nest.


Lots of animals liked to eat
dinosaur eggs!

She kept them away.
Inside the eggs
the babies grew.
They breathed through
tiny holes in the eggshells.

One day the eggs cracked!
Little baby dinosaurs came out.
They were hungry.
Maybe they squeaked.

The mother dinosaur
brought them food.
The babies ate and ate
all day long.

Dinosaur babies
had big heads and big eyes.
They could see and hear well.

Tyrannosaurus(tie-RAN-uh-SOR-us)
Human babies are born
without any teeth.
Not dinosaur babies!
They had lots of teeth.

Apatosaurus(uh-PAT-uh-SOR-us)
What did baby dinosaurs eat?
Some kinds ate leaves and
berries and seeds.

Deinonychus(die-NON-ih-kus)
Some kinds ate little animals
and bugs.

Ornithomimus(or-NIH-thuh-MY-mus)
Was it safe for baby dinosaurs
to hunt for food alone? No!

Tyrannosaurus(tie-RAN-uh-SOR-us)
Enemies were all around.

And baby dinosaurs could not
fight or run fast.
They could only hide.

Some baby dinosaurs
were lucky.
They were never alone.
They lived in herds.

Even then enemies
tried to grab
the babies and eat them!
Maybe the big dinosaurs
made a circle
and kept the little ones inside.

Babies were safe
in the dinosaur herd.
The dinosaurs walked and ate
and slept together.

Baby dinosaurs kept growing
and changing.
Some kinds grew sharp horns.

Stegosaurus
Some kinds grew spikes
on their tails.

Protoceratops
Others grew bony frills.

Brachiosaurus
They grew until
they weren’t babies
anymore.
Some grew to be the
biggest animals ever
to walk the earth!

And some had
dinosaur babies
of their own.
It is a sunny day
on the Island of Sodor.
Thomas is working
in the clay pits.

Thomas sees
giant footprints
in the rock.
The footprints
are scary!
What made them?

Thomas tells Percy
what he saw.
Percy thinks a monster
made the prints!
He is scared.

The next day
Percy goes
back to work.
He sees a dark shadow
up ahead!

Is it a monster?
No!
It is a new engine
named Gator.

Percy and Gator
are friends now.
But Percy is still
scared of monsters!
Gator tells Percy
to be brave
even if he is scared.

A big ship
is leaving Sodor.
Percy wants to go, too.
Gator says
running away
is not very brave.

Thomas wants
Percy to stay.
He sees the ship!

Pull, Cranky, pull!
The boat stops
just in time.

But Percy is not
on the boat!
He has gone back
to the clay pits.
He wants to see
the footprints.

Percy chuffs
up the mountain.
The ground shakes.
Rocks fall down.

Something big
falls near Percy.
He is sure
it is a monster!

But it is not a monster.
It is a dinosaur fossil!

Percy has made
a Really Useful
discovery!
The footprints were
made a long time ago.

Percy solved
the monster mystery!

The sun is setting.
Many animals are
going to sleep.
But the platypus

is just waking up.
Splash!
The platypus dives
under the water.
She twists and twirls.
She spins and swoops.
The platypus
likes to play.
The platypus is hungry.
She scoops up
a mouthful of
bugs and worms.
Yum!
The platypus has
thick, slick fur.
She has a
long, strong tail
like a beaver.
She is about as long
as a pet cat.
But she is not as heavy.
The platypus has
webbed feet and a bill
like a duck.
She lays eggs, too.
But is she a bird?
No.
The platypus
is a mammal.
People are mammals, too.
The platypus digs
a tunnel
in the mud.
Then she gathers
grass and leaves
from the riverbank.
She is making a nest.
The platypus lays
two eggs in the nest.
They are about
the size of gumballs.
She snuggles the eggs
between her tail
and belly.
Shhhh!
The platypus
is taking a nap.
She sleeps during
the day.
Uh-oh!
The platypus wakes up.
She hears a noise.
A snake is
in her tunnel!
It wants to
eat her eggs.
S-s-s-s!
The snake hisses.
Grrrr!
The platypus growls.
Are they going to fight?
No.
The platypus
scares off the snake.
It slithers away
to find food
somewhere else.
The platypus eggs
are safe for now.
The eggs hatch
in about two weeks.
The tiny platypus babies
drink their mom’s milk.
They stay in the tunnel
for four months
until they are bigger.
Now it is summer.
The babies
follow their mother
out of the tunnel.
They are hungry.
But they cannot
find food until
they learn to swim.
The platypus mom shows
her babies how to swim.
Her front feet push
through the water.
She steers with her
back feet and tail.
Then they learn
how to get food.
They use their bills
like big spoons.
Swoosh!
The platypus babies
are good swimmers now.
They zip and zoom
all night long.
The platypus family
loves to play!

How many
different things
can YOUR feet do?
Imagine if you could do
what reptiles do.
You could crawl, climb,
or slither just like them.
But what are reptiles?
Most reptiles hatch from eggs.
Reptiles have scales.
Reptiles are cold-blooded.
That means they need the sun
to get warm.
Crocodiles and alligators,
lizards, snakes, and turtles
are all reptiles.
Let’s learn more about them.
Activate Creature Powers!
Rattlesnakes!
A rattlesnake has special
scales on its tail.
The scales are used
to make a rattling sound.
The sound is a warning
that the snake wants
to be left alone.

They use their fangs
to catch food and
defend themselves.
Venom comes through
the fangs when they strike.
The venom is poisonous.
“Watch out!”

live underground.
They only come up
for sun, water, and food.

It can eat over a thousand ants each day!
Roadrunners!
Roadrunners are the fastest-running birds in North America.
They chase and catch lizards and other small desert creatures.
