Francis Scott Key
loved writing poems.
He wrote them
on horseback.
He wrote them
late at night.

Once Francis
even wrote a poem
after a battle.
It became
America’s national anthem.

Francis lived
in Georgetown, Virginia,
near the Potomac River.
He and his wife
had eleven children.

Francis was a lawyer.
People came to him
with their problems.
Francis liked to help.
He was always busy.

Every morning
Francis read the newspapers.
Exciting things
were happening
in young America.

It was now
free of England.
It was free to make
its own laws
and to grow
in its own way.

Trade with France
helped America grow.
Ships carried wood
and cotton to France.

They returned with
furniture and fashions.
Trade with France
could be dangerous.

England was at war
with France
and needed more sailors.
British ships followed
American ships
on the high seas.

They took the ships.
They forced the sailors to join
the English navy.
This made Americans angry.

And the anger grew.
America wanted to move
into lands west and north.
But England held forts
in the west.

They ruled Canada
in the north.

America would have to fight
England for freedom
to gain new land.
So in 1812
America declared war
on England.

Francis joined the reserves.
Reserve troops help
regular army troops.
Francis helped the troops
in northern Maryland.
He loaded, fired,
and cleaned cannons.

But he was slow and clumsy.
After ten days,
the army sent him home.

In the spring of 1813,
American troops burned down
government buildings
in Canada’s capital.
More than a year later,
the English troops
struck back.

In August 1814,
they marched on Washington.
They set fires
all over the city.
They burned down
the White House!

The British didn’t stay
for long.
They planned to attack
Fort McHenry next.
Fort McHenry protected
Baltimore’s harbor.

On their march
back to their ships,
the British troops stopped
at Dr. William Beanes’s house.
He had helped them before.
But these troops
were rude and noisy.

They stole from
the people in town.
Dr. Beanes sent someone
to get American soldiers.

They put the British troops
in jail.
This action made
a British general mad.
General Robert Ross
sent troops
to arrest Dr. Beanes.

The doctor was now
a prisoner of war!
But his friends
knew what to do.

They went to find Francis.
Rap! Rap! Rap!
They banged on his door.
It was late,
but Francis was awake.
“Dr. Beanes is in jail!”
they shouted.

The doctor was
Francis’s friend.
He wanted to help.

A few days later,
Francis set sail
with John Skinner.
John was a lawyer, too.

Their small ship
flew a white flag.
The white flag was a sign
all sailors knew.
It meant they were coming
in peace.

What if the English
did not care about
their peace flag?
But the English
did not open fire.

The two men safely boarded
the British ship.

Francis had letters
that were written
by English soldiers.

The letters said Dr. Beanes
had helped them
when they were hurt.
General Ross read the letters.
Dr. Beanes would be freed.

But there was a problem.
General Ross would not let
the three men leave.
They knew too much
about the planned attack
on Baltimore.

Francis’s ship was tied
to a British ship.

The battle began.
Cannons roared.
Rockets burst.
The air was black with smoke.
“The country is lost
if the fort falls,”
said Dr. Beanes.

“We are safe as long as
our flag still flies,”
said Francis.

The bombing went on
for twenty-five hours!
At dawn all was quiet.
Was the flag still flying?

Francis looked into a spyglass.
There was so much smoke,
he could not see the flag.
He could not even see the fort!

Suddenly sunlight
cut through
the smoke and fog.
Francis saw the flag!
It was flying high
above the fort!

Baltimore was safe.
America was still free.

Francis was filled
with pride and joy.
He sat on a barrel
and began to write
about the battle.

He wrote about how happy
he was to see
the flag still flying.
He wrote about how much
he loved his country.

Francis’s poem
was printed in the newspaper.
It was set to music.
Soon people
across the country
were singing it.

We still sing it today
in schools and
at sporting events.

The War of 1812
ended on February 17, 1815.
Francis went back
to his quiet life.
He continued
to help people
and to write poems
until the end of his life.

On a summer night
in the far north
a wolf is howling.
“OW-OOO!
OW-OOO!”

One by one, all the wolves
for miles around
throw back their heads
and join in—
“OW-OW-OW-OWOOO!”

Miles away,
a family camping
near a big lake
hears the howls.
The children grab
their parents’ hands.

Nothing sounds
as wild and scary
as a howling wolf!
Do wolves howl
just before they attack?
No!
To a wolf, a howl
is a friendly sound.
Wolves howl to let other wolves
know where they are.
They may even howl
just for fun.

Sometimes a pet dog
throws back its head and howls.
It sounds just like a wolf!
That is because wolves and dogs
are close relatives.

Long, long ago,
when people lived in caves,
some wolves began
to wait nearby
for the scraps of meat
that people threw away.
Cave children
played with the wolf pups.
Little by little,
the wolves became tame.

These tame wolves
were the first pets.
Every dog on earth today—
from tiny toy poodles
to big St. Bernards—
is related to them.

A few people still try
to tame wolves.
Eskimos have trained them
to pull dogsleds.
But a wolf
is not a house pet.
To be happy,
it must be wild and free.
A wolf’s long legs
are made for running—
up to 40 miles in a single day!

Its huge paws can be
as large as a grown-up’s hand.

Its powerful jaws can crack
the leg bone of a moose
with a single snap.

Wolves are hunters.
To stay alive,
they need fresh meat—
lots of it.
A hungry wolf can eat
20 pounds of meat
at a single meal.
That’s like eating
one hundred hamburgers!

To get all this meat,
wolves usually hunt big animals
like deer and moose.
But a hungry wolf
will chase and eat
a rabbit or a mouse.
It may even go fishing!

Wolves live in groups
called packs.
The pack members
“talk” to each other
with their bodies.

When a wolf is scared,
it holds its ears
close to its head.

When a wolf is happy,
it wags its whole tail.

If it wags just the tip,
watch out!
It is getting ready to attack.
Other wolves know these signals.
The signals help the wolves
live together without fighting.

Every pack has a lead male
and a lead female.
The lead male is strong and smart.
He will fight any wolf
that tries to take over his pack.

The lead female
is usually the mother
of the pack’s cubs.

The lead male
shows he is the boss
by the way he acts.
He looks the other wolves
right in the eye.
The other wolves tuck their tails
between their legs.
They rub noses with the leader
and lick his face.

In the spring
the lead female
gets ready to have pups.
She digs a den
in the side of a hill.
The other wolves help her.

The pups are born
in early May.
Their eyes are closed.
They cannot see or hear.
They live by drinking
their mother’s milk.

In three weeks
the pups are big enough
to leave the den.
At first they are afraid.
But soon they are racing
up and down the hillside,
playing tag.

One pup sees a grasshopper.
She pounces—SWOOSH!
But the grasshopper gets away.
The pup looks surprised.
She tries again. And again.
This is the little wolf’s
first lesson in hunting.

The adult wolves
take turns baby-sitting.
While the father
guards the pups,
they tug on his tail
and nip at his ears.
If they are too rough,
he just gets up and walks away.

The pups roll around,
pretending to fight.
One of them is stronger
than her sisters and brothers.
She holds her tail high.
She is already acting
like a lead wolf.

The pups are hungry
all the time.
When the older wolves
go hunting,
they chew extra food
and swallow it.
Back at the den,
they spit up the
chewed food—
and the hungry pups
get their first taste of meat!

By September the pups
are half-grown.
They spend hours chasing mice,
but they don’t catch any.
They are too slow and clumsy.
But soon the pups will
hunt along with the pack.
In six months
they will be good hunters.

One cold November morning
the wolves smell moose nearby.
The pack moves out
in single file
across the snow.

The wolves chase many moose.
Most of them run away.
But one big moose
stands and fights.
It kicks out
with its powerful hooves.
An angry moose can kill a wolf.
Soon the pack leaves it alone.

Finally, the wolves
find an old, sick moose.
It is too weak
to run or fight.
The pack fans out in a circle.
One wolf charges.
It bites the moose’s nose
and hangs on tight.
In minutes the fight is over.
The hungry wolves can eat.

A wolf hunting alone
might never catch a large animal.
Hunting in packs
helps all the wolves to survive.

Many people
have never seen a live wolf.
The only wolves they meet
are in fairy tales
and horror movies.
Fairy tale wolves
are greedy and dangerous.

The scariest of all
make-believe wolves
is the werewolf.
By day the werewolf
is an ordinary man or woman.

But at night,
when the moon is full,
the werewolf’s teeth
become long and sharp.
Hair grows on its face.
It runs on all fours—
just like a real wolf.
The werewolf
roams the moonlit forest
and attacks anyone it meets!

Legends about killer wolves
made many people believe
that wolves were their enemies.
For a long time
hunters shot every wolf
they could find.
They even shot wolves
from airplanes.

At last some scientists
began to wonder if wolves
really were so dangerous.
They went deep into the forest
to study how wolves live.
One scientist
was walking in the forest
when he met two wolves
by accident.

One wolf ran away.
The other wolf
walked right up to him.
The scientist was scared.
But the wolf
just licked his face
and trotted away!

The scientists learned
that healthy wolves
do not attack people.
But when wolves
wander onto farms,
they soon learn
that a lamb or a calf
makes a good dinner.

Some farmers use sheepdogs
to scare away wolves.
Some kill wolves
with poison, traps, or guns.
The American Indians
did not fear wolves.
They admired the way
wolves lived in peace together.
The Sioux Indians
told the story of a woman
who got lost in a snowstorm.
A wolf pack saved her life.
The wolves brought her food.
They let her sleep in their den.
They taught her their secrets.

When the woman
went back to her own people,
she taught them
the secrets of the wolves.
She became a powerful magician.

A few hundred years ago
wolves lived all around the world.
Thousands of wolves
lived in North America.
Today there are many more people
and fewer wolves.
In most of the United States
there are no wolves left at all
except in zoos.
Areas in red and black show where wolves once roamed. Areas in black show where wolves can be found today.

Wolves don’t cause pollution.
They live without
hurting the land.
The pack hunts to survive.
There are always
moose and deer left
to have next spring’s babies.

Today people are trying
to live in tune with nature,
as wolves do.
They want to save
some of the wild places
left on earth.
If that happens,
there will be
wild, wild wolves
howling in the forests
for years to come.

In the Attic
It was February 23, 1944.
In the city of Amsterdam,
in an attic at the top
of a tall, narrow building,
a girl sat on the dusty floor.

Through the window
she could see blue sky.
She could see the
bare branches of a chestnut tree.

The tree sparkled with dew.
“As long as this exists,”
the girl thought,
“this sunshine and
this cloudless sky,
and as long as I can enjoy it,
how can I be sad?”

The girl’s name was Anne Frank.
She had not been outside
for 597 days.

The Secret Annex
Once, Anne lived a normal life.
She collected
pictures of movie stars.
She read and wrote
and acted in plays.
She liked to make people laugh.

Anne did well in school.
She talked a lot in class.
Anne was always full of thoughts
and opinions.
She had many friends.
She had a happy life.

But on May 10, 1940,
Anne’s world changed.
World War II reached her home.
Germany invaded Holland,
the tiny country where Anne lived.

The Nazi Party,
led by Adolf Hitler,
ruled Germany.
The Nazis blamed the world’s
problems on Jewish people,
even though they were
a small minority.
Anne and her family were Jewish.

The Nazis made laws against
Jewish people.
Anne had to change schools.
She couldn’t go swimming
or see the movies she loved.

Anne’s family had to sew
yellow stars on their clothes.
All because they were Jewish.

In July 1942, a letter came for
Anne’s older sister, Margot.
The Nazis wanted to send her
to a concentration camp.

Anne’s parents knew that
when Jews were sent away,
they were never heard from again.
They had a plan.
The family would hide.

Anne packed her schoolbag.
First she packed the diary
she’d gotten for her
thirteenth birthday.
She stuffed in books,
hair curlers, and letters.

Later she wrote,
“I stuck the craziest things
in the bag, but I’m not sorry.
Memories mean more to me
than dresses.”

Early the next morning,
Anne got dressed.
She put on layers of clothing
even though it was summer.
She didn’t get to say goodbye
to anyone but her cat.

The family left the
breakfast dishes on the table.
Then they rushed away.

The hiding place
had four small rooms.
They were tucked away
behind a bookcase
above Anne’s father’s office.

From a window in her new room,
Anne could see a chestnut tree.
But then the windows
had to be covered.
If anyone saw Anne’s family,
they might be arrested.

Anne called the hiding place
the Secret Annex.
At first it felt like an adventure.

But as time went on,
life became harder.
Four more people moved in.
Anne had to share a room
with a dentist.

There was little food.
They had to be very quiet.
At night they listened
to the radio,
hoping the war would be over.

Only a few people knew
where Anne’s family was.
These helpers brought food,
clothes, and other supplies.
If they were caught,
they would be arrested.
But the helpers never complained.

Anne and the other children
did schoolwork every day.
Anne loved when their helpers
brought books and news.
But she still missed home.

Writing helped Anne feel better.
She named her diary Kitty,
after a character
in her favorite books.
Anne told Kitty her fears
for her friends outside.

She told Kitty about the planes
that dropped bombs at night.
Guns on the ground
fired at the planes.
The Secret Annex shook.
Anne climbed into bed
with her parents,
but she was still afraid.

When Anne was very scared,
she ran up and down,
up and down the stairs.
She told Kitty she felt
like a bird trapped in a cage.
“Let me out,
where there’s fresh air
and laughter!” she wrote.

In the world around her,
Anne saw fighting and fear.
But in the blue sky above,
she saw beauty and peace.
So she climbed up to the attic.

The windows there
were not covered.
Anne looked out and saw
the tall chestnut tree.
She felt the sun on her face.
Seeing the tree and sky
calmed Anne.
It helped her feel brave.

Anne stayed up late to glimpse
the moon from a window.

She noticed the passing seasons
by watching the chestnut tree
grow buds and leaves.

Anne put nature into her stories.
In a story called “Fear,”
a girl flees a city
where bombs are falling.

She reaches a meadow.
She lies down in the grass.
She looks at the moon and stars
and realizes she’s not
afraid anymore.

Nature made Anne feel
that God had not left her.
She wrote in her diary,
“I firmly believe that nature can
bring comfort to all who suffer.”

Anne decided she wanted
to be a writer.
Maybe her words would mean
something to other people.
She worked for weeks
editing her diary.
She was almost done.

But on August 4, 1944,
the police found the Secret Annex.
The Nazis sent Anne’s family
and two of their helpers
to concentration camps.

Anne’s Chestnut Tree
Anne did not survive the war.
But her diary did.
After the Franks were taken away,
helpers crept back to the Annex.
A helper named Miep Gies
hid the pages in her desk.
She saved Anne’s writing.

Millions of people
have read Anne’s words.
Anne wrote,
“I want to go on living
even after my death!”
She has.

Today you can visit
Anne’s Secret Annex.
You can peer up the stairs
into the attic.
You can see where Anne
gazed at the sky
and the great chestnut tree.

Visitors loved the tree.
For them it stood for hope.
When the tree became sick,
people tried to save it.
They braced the tree to hold it up.
But in 2010,
a storm knocked it down.

Even so, Anne’s tree lives on.
People grew saplings
from the tree’s chestnuts.
Hundreds were planted in Amsterdam.
Others were planted at schools
named for Anne around the world.

In the United States,
saplings will grow in important
places across the country.

Like the saplings
from her chestnut tree,
Anne Frank’s words have been
planted around the world.
They have been planted
in schools, museums,
and libraries.

They have been planted
in the minds of the millions
who read her diary.
And there they grow,
inspiring people to see the world
as Anne did.
Hop on a train.
They are a great way to travel.
New ones fly down the tracks.

Old trains are fun too.
They click-clack on old tracks.
They let you pretend
you are living long ago.
New or old,
trains are an adventure.

This train’s name is the Jacobite.
Mostly it takes people home or to work.
It passes lakes.
It crosses bridges.


Other times, it’s a movie star!
It plays the Hogwarts Express.
It takes Harry Potter
and his friends to school.
What’s the best thing
about a train ride?
Sometimes it’s what you see
outside your window.

This trip has great scenery.
Sadly, there are no passengers
to see it.
The train is coming from a mine.
It is carrying salt to a factory.
But the crew can enjoy the view!

The best thing about a trip
may be the train itself.
Trains can be hotels in motion!
You can rent your own room.
It is very small.
But you have everything you need.
You can read.
You can wash up.

You can get a good night’s sleep!

The restaurant car
serves meals all day long!
Trains are an adventure.

In 1829
George Stephenson built
the first modern locomotive.
He called it the Rocket.
It raced about 35 miles an hour!

Its speed changed the world.
Stagecoaches took four days
to travel 150 miles.
Trains took only four hours.
The Age of the Railroad began.
Soon trains were running
all over the world.

Early trains ran on steam power.
Engines burned coal
to boil water.
The water turned to steam.

The steam built up
and pushed parts of the engine.
These parts moved
and turned the wheels.

Here are the parts of
a steam train:


By 1860 the eastern United States
had many railroads.
But the country needed one
to go from coast to coast.

In 1863 work began in the West.
Workers built bridges over rivers.
They blasted through mountains.

In 1869 two engines
faced each other in Utah.
One had traveled from the East.
The other came from the West.
One last rail
would connect all the tracks.
Workers hammered it in
with a spike of solid gold!

Trains carried cargo and people.
Some even carried queens!
Queen Victoria of England
had her own train.
It was the first one to have
a bathroom in it!

Trains used steam power
for a long time.
Then the diesel engine took over.
It burns oil to make electricity.
The electricity drives the train.
Diesels are cheaper to run
than steam engines.
They do not need as much repair.
We still use diesel engines today.

Freight trains carry huge loads.
They can have over
two hundred cars!
They can be two miles long!

Long trains need
more than one engine
to pull them.
Trains are great for hauling things.
They use less fuel than trucks.
They create less pollution.
Trains crisscross
the United States all day long.
They haul almost half its cargo.
They even carry trucks
filled with freight!

A truck reaches its stop.
Then it drives off and delivers its goods.
Freight trains stop in rail yards
along their route.
They pick up new cars.
They leave other ones behind.
Some cars get unloaded there.
Some cars link with new trains
to get to their last stop.

Freight is often carried
in big boxes called containers.
They are lifted onto flatcars.

Flatcars carry lots of cargo.
They haul anything
that can get wet
if it rains or snows.
Even tanks can hitch a ride!

Cars are built
to carry different cargo.
Hopper cars are open
and easy to unload.
They work well for coal or sand.

Tankers hold liquids.
Some keep their cargo cold.
This tanker is full of juice!

Boxcars are closed,
so they keep cargo clean and dry.
You never know
what could be inside!

Commuter trains take people
to the city each morning.
They bring them home at night.
Double-deckers
carry lots of passengers.
They save lots of gas too!


Train stations
can be a city’s hub.
Commuter trains pull in.
Some trains depart
for faraway places.
Others arrive all day and night.
Travelers hop on trains
that take them around the city.
Subways are trains
that travel underground.
Subways use electricity to run.
A rail next to the tracks
supplies this power.

Subways can get very crowded.
In Japan,
men called pushers
help pack people in.

Trolleys travel on city streets.
They use electricity too.
It comes from wires above them
or underground.


Look up!
A train could be overhead.
Monorails do not use tracks.
They run on just one rail.
Rubber tires supply a quiet ride.
And you get a great view!
Want another great view?
Ride a funicular railway.
It goes up and down steep hills.
A funicular has two tracks.
It has one car on each of them.
They are joined by a cable.
The cable pulls one car uphill
as it pulls the other down.

Long ago
trains used to be
the fastest way to travel.
Now we have jets.
But trains are moving faster too.

Old tracks slow trains down.
Some old tracks have curves.
Trains must brake
when going around a curve.
Some new trains
still use these tracks.
They just tilt while turning.
They lean the way bicycles do.
These trains go up to
150 miles an hour.

Most people in the United States
fly or drive between cities.
In other nations
people use trains instead.
New tracks have been laid.
The rails are straight.
So their trains go much faster.


Pointed high-speed trains
are called bullet trains.
Are they as fast as bullets?
Not really.
But they seem to fly!
Some go up to 220 miles an hour.
TGV trains in France go fast too.
One of them
was the world’s fastest train.
It went 357 miles an hour!

Maglev trains do not have wheels.
Their tracks are different too.
Magnets make the trains float
above the rails.
Trains gliding on air go fast!
How fast?
One maglev races
360 miles an hour!

What else will new trains do?
Some new trains will weigh less.

A lighter train can save fuel.
Using less fuel means less pollution.
Some trains may have solar panels.
The sun’s energy will help them run.

New trains will be
different inside too.
Look at this one!
Big glass windows.
Seats with movies and games.
Private compartments.
What a ride!

The trains of the future
will be amazing!


Do you believe in fairies?
People around the world
have told stories about fairies
for a long time.

In some stories,
fairies come out to dance
when the moon is full.
Sometimes they steal babies
from their cradles.
They leave fairy children
in their place.

In Ireland,
fairies are called
the wee folk.
In parts of Africa,
there are kind fairies
called azizas (say ah-ZEE-zahz).

The brownies of England
and Scotland are helpful.
They run errands
and clean stables.
But not all fairies are friendly.

Britain’s ugly spriggans
bring bad weather to ruin crops.
And the leshy,
or Slavic forest fairies,
beat people with sticks
and tree limbs.

Cautious travelers carried
dry bread in their pockets
to protect themselves
from fairy mischief.

More than two centuries ago,
brothers Jacob and
Wilhelm Grimm
spent many years
collecting German fairy tales.
Their book,
Children’s and Household Tales,
was published in 1812.
It became popular
around the world.

But are fairies real?
Today, most people say no.
Some folklore researchers,
though, say maybe.

They say that
a long time ago
in Great Britain
there may have been
a group of small people.
They may have been conquered
by tall invaders.

To avoid capture,
these small people
hid in the forest.
They wore green clothes
so they would be hard to spot.

They came out only at night
to hunt and steal food.
Sometimes they even switched
their sick babies for healthy ones.
Over time,
these small people died off.
But their neighbors
still told tales about them.

There are others
who say fairies are real.
They insist they have seen them!
In 1842,
in Stowmarket, England,
a man saw a dozen fairies
dancing in the moonlight.

He ran home
and told his neighbors.
They rushed back
to the meadow.
But when they got there,
the fairies had disappeared.

William Blake was a famous
British poet.
He claimed to have seen
a fairy funeral.

He told his friends
the fairies were
as small as grasshoppers.
They carried a dead fairy
on a rose petal.
They sang a sad song
as they passed him
in the garden.

Did these men
really see fairies?
Maybe.
Maybe not.
People sometimes make up stories
to explain things
they don’t understand.

Weather can play tricks
on our eyes.
Fairies dancing in a meadow
might be nothing more
than fireflies or snowflakes.

Some people who think
they have seen fairies
have been tricked.
The most famous fairy prank
took place
in Cottingley, England.

One afternoon in July 1917,
two cousins named Elsie Wright
and Frances Griffiths
drew some pretty fairy pictures.
They cut them out
like paper dolls.

Elsie took a photo of Frances
talking to the fairies.
Frances took a photo of fairies
dancing in Elsie’s lap.

Elsie’s father,
Mr. Wright,
developed the photos.
At first,
he was puzzled.
He thought the blurry images
were birds or empty bags.

Elsie told him
that she and Frances
had found fairies in the woods.

Three years later,
Elsie’s mother met a man
named Edward Gardner.
He was a well-known teacher
of fairy folklore.
Mrs. Wright told him
that her daughter had
taken photos of fairies.

Mr. Gardner showed the photos
to men at the Kodak camera lab
in London.
One man said
the pictures were fake.

But another man noticed
a blur in a photo.
He said that meant
the fairy was moving.
He said the photos were real!

Mr. Gardner was delighted.
He told everyone he knew
that fairies lived
in Cottingley Woods.
He asked the girls
to take more fairy photos.

They agreed.
They sent three more photos
to Mr. Gardner.

Newspapers reported
the amazing news.
“Fairies in Yorkshire,”
the headlines declared.
“An Epic-Making Event.”

Some people laughed.
Others believed
the fairies were real.
They went to Cottingley
to hunt for fairies.
They visited Elsie and Frances.
They asked the girls
to show them where
they had taken the photos.

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
was a famous author.
He wrote
the Sherlock Holmes
mystery stories.
He believed
Elsie and Frances’s
fairies were real.

In 1922,
Sir Arthur wrote
about Frances and Elsie
in a book called
The Coming of the Fairies.

All over England,
people read it.
More and more visitors
went to Cottingley.
The town became famous.
People called it Fairyland.

Many years went by.
In 1981,
when Elsie and Frances
were old women,
they admitted that the
fairy photos were a joke.
“It was just Elsie and I
having a bit of fun,”
Frances said.

“I can’t understand to this day
why they were taken in.”
Elsie said the fairies
were only paper cutouts
mounted on twigs
with long, sharp hat pins.

This fairy hoax
happened long ago.
But the photos
are still famous.
Recently,
they sold for almost $40,000!

People still go to Cottingley
to look for fairies in the woods.
They still read
the fairy tales written
by the Brothers Grimm.
There are poems and plays
about fairies, too.

Could some of
the old fairy stories be true?
Will a piece of dry bread
protect you
from fairy troublemakers?
What do you think?

Sometimes people find bones
of ancient animals.
Some of these bones
are from dinosaurs.

The bones are like
parts of a puzzle.
When they are put together,
you can see
what a dinosaur looked like.

The word dinosaur looks hard,
but it is really easy to say.
Say: DIE-nuh-sor.
Dinosaur means “fearfully great lizard.”

Millions of years ago
the world belonged
to dinosaurs.

In the days of the dinosaurs,
there were no people.
No dogs or cats.
No horses or cows.

What animals were there?
Turtles.
Crocodiles.
Fish.
Dragonflies.
The world was warmer
than today,
and very wet in some places.

One of the very first dinosaurs
was Panphagia
(pan-FAYG-ee-uh).

Panphagia lived in a forest.
The forest was full
of giant reptiles.

When these giants got hungry,
they came after Panphagia.
SNAP! went the giants’ jaws.
SNAP! SNAP!
Then Panphagia
ran away as fast as it could
on its strong back legs.

Panphagia could eat
leaves, meat, and bugs.
That is how it got its name.
Panphagia means “eats anything.”

Panphagia was a small dinosaur.
It was about the size of a turkey.
Dinosaurs came in many sizes.
Some were small like Panphagia.
Some were big.
And some
were very, very big.

One of the biggest
was Argentinosaurus
(ar-jun-TEE-nuh-SAW-rus).

This dinosaur was
as big as a house,
longer than three buses,
and as heavy
as thirteen elephants!

The name Argentinosaurus
means “lizard from Argentina.”
That is the country
where its bones were found.
Argentinosaurus ate plants.
Lots of them!

Other dinosaurs hunted
for meat to eat.
One meat-eater
was named Mapusaurus
(MAH-poo-SAW-rus).

A grown-up Argentinosaurus
was too big for most
meat-eaters to hunt.
But a baby Argentinosaurus
would be the right size
for a snack.

This dinosaur was not big
and it was not fast.
It could not run and hide.
But it did not need to!

Its back was protected
by bony plates.
Its name was Scelidosaurus
(skeh-LIH-duh-SAW-rus).
It was one of the first
armored dinosaurs.

Not all kinds of dinosaurs
lived at the same time.
Early dinosaurs
like Scelidosaurus
died out.
New kinds
took their place.

Some of the newer dinosaurs
looked a little like ducks.
They are called
duck-billed dinosaurs.

This duck-billed dinosaur
is called Edmontosaurus
(ed-MON-tuh-SAW-rus).

Edmontosaurus had lots of teeth.
Almost one thousand of them!
It used its teeth
to mash up plants.

This is Tyrannosaurus rex
(tie-RAN-uh-SAW-rus REX).
It had some of the biggest teeth
of all dinosaurs.

Its teeth were as long as bananas
and very strong.
The word rex means “king.”
This dinosaur was the king
of the hunters.
What did it hunt?
Other dinosaurs!

Some dinosaurs
had ways to keep safe
from Tyrannosaurus rex.
This dinosaur
had hard plates on its back.
The plates were like armor.
When danger was near,
it just sat tight.

The name of this dinosaur
is Ankylosaurus
(an-KEE-luh-SAW-rus).
Ankylosaurus also had
a strong tail.
It could swing its tail
like a club.

This dinosaur
used its sharp horns
for fighting.
When it charged,
everyone got out of the way!

Its name is Triceratops
(try-SER-uh-tops).
That means “three-horned face.”

We know some amazing things
about dinosaurs.
We know that some
had feathers like birds!
We know that some were colored
black and red and white and brown.
But we do not know the colors
of most of them.

We also know
how dinosaurs were born.
They hatched from eggs,
just like baby birds!

Some dinosaur eggs
were big …
even bigger than a football.
But some were only the size
of a potato.

This dinosaur
is named Citipati
(CHEE-tee-pah-tee).
The mother and father
made nests in the sand.
The mother laid many eggs.
The mother and father took turns
sitting on the eggs.
Their feathers
helped keep the eggs warm.

When the babies were born,
they were very small.
Much, much smaller
than their parents.
You could hold
a baby Citipati
in your hands.

In the days of the dinosaurs,
strange animals
lived in the sea.
They were real-life sea monsters.
Some of these monsters
looked like dinosaurs.

But they were not dinosaurs.
They are called plesiosaurs
(PLEE-zee-uh-SORS).
They had long necks.
They reached into the water
to catch fish.

Other strange animals
flew in the air.
One of these animals
was Pteranodon
(tuh-RAN-uh-don).
Its body was no bigger
than a turkey’s.
But its wings were as wide
as the wings of a small plane.

Pteranodon flew far out to sea.
It rested on the tops of waves.
When it took off,
it soared on the wind
like a glider.

The days of the dinosaurs
lasted a very long time.
Millions and millions of years.
Then a time came
when an asteroid
smashed into the earth.
An asteroid is a
giant rock from space.

The darkness and the cold
meant most dinosaurs
could not find food to eat.

But one kind of
little feathered flying dinosaur
survived.

We still have these dinosaurs today.
They are called birds!
So the dinosaur days go on.

Have you ever
looked at a bug
up close?
You might see horns
or armor or spikes.
If bugs were your size,
they’d be scary.

No bug is as big as you.
But some are huge for bugs.
And some are fierce!
This book is all about
the biggest and fiercest bugs
in the world.

The heaviest bug
is the goliath beetle of Africa.
How heavy is it?
Get two eggs
out of the fridge.
Hold them together
in your hand.
That’s how heavy
one goliath beetle is.

But goliath beetles
are gentle.
Some kids even keep them
as pets!

Not all beetles
are gentle.
The giant stag beetle
is a fighter!

These two beetles
are fighting over
a female.

One male grabs the other
in its huge jaws,
lifts it into the air,
and slams it down
on the ground!

A mouse wants to eat
this juicy bombardier beetle.
But the beetle
fires boiling-hot gas
from its rear end.

Bang! Bang! Bang!
Each burst explodes
like a firecracker.
The gas bombs
burn and sting,
and the mouse
runs away.

Giant waterbugs
stab their victims
and suck their blood
like vampires!

The mother waterbug
glues her eggs
to the father’s back.
He carries them around
until they hatch.
Then, if the babies don’t
swim away quickly,
he might eat them!

What’s the stinkiest,
smelliest bug?
A stinkbug.

When a bird
scares a stinkbug,
the bug oozes
a horrible, smelly
liquid.

The bird flies away.
It doesn’t want
a dinner
that stinks.

Australian
walking sticks
are the longest
of all bugs.
Hungry birds
love to eat them.

The walking stick
doesn’t have big jaws
or burning gas
to fight with.
But it can
hold very still
and hide.
Look closely.
Can you see it
against this branch?

Some praying mantises
are as long as bananas.

This one jabs
a curious frog
with the spikes on its legs.
Pow! Pow!
The frog hops away.

A praying mantis
will eat anything
smaller than itself.
Even a baby bird
that falls from its nest.
After eating, the mantis
washes its face
like a kitten.

Army ants are killers.
Millions of them
march through the forest.

They eat anything
they can catch—
cockroaches, spiders, beetles,
and scorpions.

When they come
to a village,
even people hurry
to get out
of their way.

Grrrrrrrr!
Imagine falling into
a lion’s den.
It’s happening
to these ants.
A hungry ant lion
has dug a pit.
It hides at the bottom,
buried in sand.
Only its powerful
jaws stick out.

When an ant falls in,
the ant lion grabs it,
sucks it dry,
and throws away the shell.

The body of a female
black widow spider
is smaller than a dime,
but her poison
is stronger
than a rattlesnake’s.

How did the
black widow
get its name?
Sometimes the female
spider kills and eats
her mate!

The raft spider
eats tadpoles
and little fish.

It stabs a minnow
with its deadly fangs,
pulls it
out of the water,
and gobbles it up.

Tarantulas are hairy spiders.
A big one would cover
your dinner plate.

Most tarantulas are gentle.
But some have
an unusual weapon—
their own hair.

When a coyote
tries to eat it,
the tarantula kicks
a cloud of itchy hairs
into the air.
The hairs make the coyote
cough and scratch.
Now the tarantula
can escape.

A tarantula’s worst enemy
is a fierce wasp called
a tarantula hawk.

The spider tries to
fight off the wasp.
But the wasp darts in
and stings it.

Now the spider can’t move.
The wasp drags it into its burrow
and lays an egg on it.
After the egg hatches,
the baby wasp
eats the tarantula alive.

Have you ever been
stung by a bee?
It hurts!

One bee sting
is bad enough.
But how about
hundreds of stings?
Killer bees are
smaller than other bees—
but a lot fiercer.
When they get mad,
they chase and sting
their enemies.

One man was stung
two thousand times!
A big dog
was stung to death.

The assassin bug
is another killer.
 
This assassin bug
is creeping up
on a caterpillar.
Suddenly it plunges
its sharp beak
into the caterpillar’s
furry body.
Then it squirts in poison.
The caterpillar’s insides
turn to mush.

The assassin bug
sucks up the mush
and goes hunting
for another meal.

A female horsefly
punctures the skin
of horses and cows
with her
sharp mouth parts.
Then she sucks
their blood.

In Africa
some horseflies
even suck the blood
of crocodiles!

Some moths
are as big
as birds.
 
If a giant atlas moth
sat right here,
its wings would
cover both pages.

The atlas moth is huge,
but it still has enemies.
How does it
protect itself?
Its wing tips look
like snake heads.
Most animals are
afraid of snakes.
They leave the moth alone.

How far can you
stick out your tongue?
 
The long-tongued
sphinx moth
has a tongue
eleven inches long.
That’s four times
as long as its body.

If a ten-year-old boy
had a tongue like that,
it would be as long as
his mother’s car!

Look at these
huge cockroaches!
Luckily, you won’t
find them
in your kitchen.

Madagascar hissing
cockroaches
live on an island
near Africa.

If a bird grabs one,
the cockroach hisses loudly.
Hsssssssssssssssss!
The startled bird
drops the cockroach
and flies away.

Some millipedes
ooze poison
when they are
frightened.

Indians in Mexico
used to grind up
millipedes
to make a deadly poison.
Before a battle,
they rubbed the poison
on their arrows.

Most bugs won’t
hurt you.
Bugs are important.
They are food
for many other
creatures.
And they help trees
and flowers grow.

Bugs keep
our planet clean
by eating dead plants
and animals.

We couldn’t live
without bugs—
even the biggest,
scariest
monster bugs!
Bob Chandler loved his
pickup truck.
He liked driving it
over rocks and mud.
Bob got bigger tires
so he could do that.
Then Bob thought the truck
needed more power.
He added a bigger engine.


Bob kept making
his truck bigger and stronger.
That’s how the first
monster truck was born!
Bob named it Bigfoot.
He took Bigfoot to car shows.
Fans loved this
super-sized machine.
Soon other people began building
monster trucks of their own.
Then Bob had a new idea.
He drove his truck
over some old cars.
Bigfoot flattened them
into a car pancake!
The crowds loved it!
Monster trucks had a new trick.

Before long,
people started to race
monster trucks.
The trucks were already strong.
Now they had to be fast, too.

Some trucks have crazy names,
like Nitemare, The Crash Master,
and Towasaurus Wrex.
Some are painted to look like
wild creatures.
But they all roar like monsters!

Monster trucks are amazing.
They are very heavy.
Yet they can jump more than
twenty feet in the air.
Huge motors help them fly.
These motors can be
six times more powerful
than a car engine.
They make a lot of noise, too.

Monster trucks can go fast.
They use a lot of fuel
when they race.
They burn almost
one gallon of fuel each second!

Monster trucks spin.
They plow through mud.

They roll over cars
and crush them like bugs.

They usually ride on
four wheels.
At times they use just two.


Sometimes a truck comes down
from a jump too hard.
This one lost a wheel!
Don’t worry!
The crew can fix
almost anything.

A monster truck IS a monster.
It is huge.
It weighs about 10,000 pounds.
That is as heavy as
an elephant.

Its tires are huge, too.
They are at least
sixty-six inches high.
Each one can weigh
900 pounds.



Monster trucks make many jumps.
They go over lots of bumps.
Cars and trucks have
parts called shocks.
The shocks soften the ride.
Monster trucks need
super shocks!
A special gas pedal keeps
the driver’s foot in place
during bumpy rides.

Look closely at a
monster truck.

The body is all one piece.
Its doors and headlights
are not real.
They are just painted on.
The steering wheel
turns the front tires.
Drivers have a special lever
to steer the back ones.

This helps the truck
make tighter turns.

Racing can be dangerous.
So monster trucks have
extra safety features.
A metal roll cage
protects the driver
if the truck tips over.
Drivers wear
five-point safety belts.

A fire extinguisher
is kept close by
in case there is a problem.
Clear plastic floors
also help drivers stay safe.
Monster trucks are so tall
that drivers cannot see the track
right in front of them.
They need to know
if it is clear
to come down from a wheelie.
So they look through
their floors to find out!

Monster truck drivers
like to set records.
So they try new tricks.
In 1999 Bigfoot tried a stunt
never done before.
Monsters had jumped over cars.
They had sailed over trucks.
This time Bigfoot would
fly over a plane!
Bigfoot’s engine roared.
Driver Dan Runte had to go
at least sixty miles an hour
to make it over the jet.
He raced up the ramp
faster than that.
Bigfoot soared into the air
and over the jet!

Bigfoot set two records that day.
Dan set a new monster truck
speed record by going
almost seventy miles an hour.
And Bigfoot jumped 202 feet!

Another time,
Ghost Ryder did
the first backflip
ever completed at a show.

Black Stallion was the first
to fly over a moving target.
Monster trucks often jump cars
that are standing still.
This red monster was driving
right at Black Stallion!

Bigfoot 5 is the world’s tallest
monster truck.
Its tires are ten feet tall!

Stunts and records are great.
But many people
love races the best.
The show starts tomorrow.
Thrasher’s crew gets ready to go.
Crews sometimes travel
hundreds of miles to compete.
That is a lot of driving
to race for just a few minutes!


Monster trucks are not allowed
to drive on public roads.
They must ride in trailers.
But they are too big to fit in.
So drivers replace
the giant tires
with smaller ones.
Then they drive the truck in.
They also pack spare parts.
Racing causes a lot of
breakdowns!


At the track, workers are busy.
They are preparing the course.
Forklifts stack cars in a pile.
Bulldozers push dirt into
mounds.

Trucks pack the dirt down.
They are making strong ramps
so the monsters can fly!

The drivers arrive and
unload their trucks.
They put the big tires back on.
They make sure everything
is working right.
Then they wash their trucks down.

The monsters
and their drivers
are ready to star
in their show.

The monster trucks rumble
onto the track.
The crowd cheers.
It is time to race.


Monster trucks race
two at a time.
Each pair lines up side by side.
The drivers rev their engines.
The crowd begins
the countdown.
“… three, two, one, GO!”
The trucks soar over
the first ramp.

They fly over the second one.
They hit the third at full speed.

These trucks get a lot
of air time!
Freestyle time is another part
of the show.
The drivers do whatever stunts
they want.
Big Dawg crushes the vans.

Avenger is going to jump high.
The driver straightens the tires.
When the wheels hit the cars,

the driver guns the motor.
Up it goes!

General Tire does a “donut.”
This means that the truck
drives in small circles.
The driver steers
the front tires
to the left.

He uses his lever to turn
the rear tires
to the right.

The monster truck goes
round and round.
Look at that mud fly!
The monster trucks are done.
But the next event is fun, too.
The drivers come out
to be with their fans.

This show is over.
There will be another soon.
Over 12 million people
go to monster truck shows
each year.
Monster trucks race
all over the world!

That’s because they are
monstrously fun!


The armadillo sneaks out
to hunt on a summer night.
(Say ar-muh-DIH-loh.)
Her walk is slow and clumsy.

She stands up on her back legs
to listen and sniff the air.
Uh-oh!
She smells danger.

A bobcat is on the prowl.
The armadillo knows
what to do.
Like a digging machine,
she rips the ground
with her claws.
Quickly she disappears
inside the hole.

The bobcat finally gives up.
That’s good for the armadillo.
All that digging
has made her hungry.

The armadillo grunts and
hunts with her nose in the dirt.

Armadillos do not see well.
So she uses her sharp senses
of smell and hearing
to find food.

Tonight, she picks up
the scent of a beetle.
Yum!

She is so hungry
she doesn’t notice
a man waiting to chase her away.
People get mad
when armadillos make holes
in their yards.
They also say armadillos stink.

The surprised armadillo squeals.
She leaps straight up—
three feet in the air.
Jumping startles her enemies
and gives her time to get away.

With a dog close behind,
she runs in a zigzag trail.
She dashes inside
a prickly bush.

Ouch!
The dog backs away
from the thorns.
But why doesn’t the armadillo
feel the spikes?
She is protected by a shell
from the tip of her tail
to her nose.

“Armadillo” means
“little armored one”
in Spanish.
The armor is
made of thin bony plates
covered with tough skin.
In the center are nine narrow bands.
The skin feels like stiff leather.

The armadillo tucks her head
into her shell.
Now her eyes are safe.
When she pulls her feet in,
her armor lowers to the ground.

Although the armor over her
shoulders and bottom is solid,
the bands in the middle move.
She curls her head to her tail.

She is a
nine-banded armadillo—
the only kind of armadillo
that lives wild
in the United States.
She is the size of a house cat.

The dog just won’t give up.
Where can the armadillo go?
Ah! A fence.
She scrambles up and over.

Now the armadillo
is really hungry—and lucky.
She has landed by a garden.
She loves plowed fields,
lawns, and gardens
with soft dirt and many bugs.
Her favorite food is insects.

But she is not picky.
She will eat anything small
in her path, like fruit, lizards,
tarantulas, snails, mice,
scorpions, and bird eggs.

But what about this snake?
With a flick of her tongue,
she slurps up the snake
and swallows him whole.
The armadillo uses her dull,
round teeth only
to chew hard foods.

The armadillo smells worms
eight inches below the ground—
also fire ants.
Her claws tear the ground.
Her long tongue
darts in and out.

With each flick,
its sticky coating
and rough surface
collect hundreds of ant eggs.
Like her cousin the anteater,
she can eat 40,000 ants
in one meal.

But suddenly
she leaps backward.
Ants can’t hurt her shell,
but they sting
the end of her nose
and her belly.
They even sting the skin
between her nine bands.

She will return to this hole
when insects gather again.

Now the armadillo
must cross a stream.
She breathes in
to fill her lungs.
She swallows air
to expand her belly.
Gulp.
It swells by three inches.
Then the armadillo paddles—
puffed up and floating.

Sometimes she floats on logs.

Sometimes she walks
across the bottom of the stream.
She can hold her breath
for six minutes underwater.
It’s another good way to hide.

As summer turns to fall,
the armadillo digs a home.
She already has other burrows
to escape to in her hunting area.
She digs under the roots of trees
so she has a strong roof above.

Her burrows can be
twenty feet long,
with different rooms.
They often have
several entrances.
If a skunk or another armadillo
moves in, she shares her home.

Armadillos do not like
cold weather.
That’s why they mainly
live in the southern part
of the United States.
In late fall and winter,
the armadillo will hunt when
the sun is out.

Brrrr.
She runs around in circles
to warm up.

She piles leaves high
over her doors
to keep out the chill.
If it’s too cold,
she sleeps a long time
in her burrow without eating.

The armadillo prepares a nest
for her babies in the spring.
She carries straw and grass
with her front legs.
Then she hops backward.

She uses her tail to feel
her way into the burrow
and to the bedroom.
She made the bedroom a pit,
lower than the other rooms.

Nine-banded armadillos
always produce four babies,
or quadruplets (kwah-DROO-pluts).
The four pups are
always exactly alike.
This mom’s pups are male.
They are born with
their eyes open.
They walk and play right away.

Like other mammals,
an armadillo feeds
her babies with her milk.
Yet she is the only mammal
with a shell.
Her babies’ armor
feels like rubber,
but the shells will harden
as the pups grow.

In a few weeks,
she takes her pups outside.
She has lots to teach them.

Months later,
four hungry armadillos
sneak out to hunt for food.
They smell danger!
They know just what to do.

This is a true story
about a very brave dog.
His name was Balto.
The year was 1925.
Balto lived in Nome, Alaska.
Nome was a frontier town.
Most of the year it was buried
under ice and snow.

In winter there was no way
to travel through all that ice and snow.
Not on planes or trains or boats or cars.
The only way to travel in Alaska
was by dog sled.

Balto was a sled dog.
He worked for a gold-mining company
not far from Nome.
He helped carry food and tools
to the miners.
It was a good life for a sled dog.

Balto’s driver was named Gunnar.
Gunnar made Balto his lead dog.
The lead dog runs in front
of the team.
He follows the trail.

All the other dogs do
whatever the lead dog does.
So the lead dog has to be
the smartest and strongest dog of all.

One cold winter day
a terrible thing happened in Nome.
Two children got very sick.

Their parents called the doctor.
He was the only doctor
in the whole town.

When the doctor saw the children
he was very worried.
The children had a terrible sickness.
It was called diphtheria (dif-THEER-ee-ah).
The doctor did not have
the medicine he needed.
Without the medicine
the children would die.

Without the medicine
many other people in Nome
would get diphtheria and die too.
The doctor knew
he had to get some medicine–fast.

The hospital in Anchorage, Alaska,
had the medicine.
But Anchorage was 800 miles away.
The doctors in Anchorage
put the medicine on a train.
But soon the train got stuck
in the deep snow.
The train was still 700 miles
from Nome!

The people of Nome held a meeting.
Everyone was very scared.
“What are we going to do?”
asked the doctor.
“We have to get that medicine.”
At last someone said,
“What about a dog-sled relay?
When one team of dogs gets tired,
a new team will be ready to take over.”

The room buzzed with excitement.
That did seem like the quickest way
to get the medicine.
But the doctor frowned.
“It will still take about fifteen days.
That’s a long time. Too long.”

Maybe the doctor was right.
But there was no other choice.
So the mayor spoke over the radio.
“Please help!” he said.
“We need the best drivers and dogs
to help save our town!”
Gunnar heard the mayor on the radio.
Gunnar knew he had the best dog team
and the best lead dog.
Balto would come to the rescue.

On January 27, 1925,
the race to Nome began.
Twenty-one dog teams
were in the relay.
Each team waited at a different stop.

The first driver took the medicine
from the train.
He wrapped it in fur
to keep it from freezing.
Then he drove his dogs
as fast as he could to the second stop.
He made his run in good time.

But soon the wind began to blow hard.
The air grew colder.
A blizzard was coming!
It was one of the worst storms ever.
Still the race went on.
Somehow each dog team made it
to the next stop.

In one team, two dogs froze to death.
So the driver hitched himself
to the sled.
He helped the rest of his dogs
pull through the storm.

Gunnar and Balto waited
at their stop in Bluff.
They were going to run 31 miles
from Bluff to Point Safety.
That was the second-to-last part
of the race.
But the storm had slowed things down.

Gunnar had been waiting for two days.
He did not sleep.
He wanted to be ready to go
as soon as the medicine arrived.

At last Gunnar heard dogs barking.
The medicine was here!
He put it on the sled
with a small stove and a little food.
Then he hitched up his dogs.
Balto stood proudly in the lead.

Gunnar cracked his whip.
“Mush!” he cried.
That meant “go.”
The team ran out into the snowy night.

At first the team made good time.
But soon snowdrifts blocked the trail.
The dogs sank up to their necks
in snow.
They could not move.
Some began to panic.

But not Balto.
He stayed calm.
That helped the other dogs
while Gunnar dug them out
of the snow.
At last the team was on its way again.

Then the team crossed a frozen river.
The dogs and the sled
slipped and skidded on the ice.
Oh, no! Over went the sled.
Gunnar got it up again.
But the medicine was gone!

Wildly Gunnar dug for the medicine.
He could not see
through the heavy snow.
But at last he felt the package.
He put it back on the sled.

The team kept going
across the river.
Suddenly Balto stopped short.
“Mush, Balto!” shouted Gunnar.
But Balto did not move.

Then Gunnar saw why.
The ice was cracking!
If the team fell into the river,
they would all drown.

Balto had stopped just in time.
“Smart dog!” Gunnar told him.
Then he saw that Balto’s feet were wet.
If they froze,
Balto would never walk again.
Quickly Gunnar unhitched Balto
from the sled.

He led the dog
to a patch of powdery snow.
Gunnar rubbed Balto’s paws
in the powder.
Soon they were dry.
Balto was ready to go once more.

Balto led the team
around the cracking ice.
At last they reached
solid land again.
Were they still on the trail?
Gunnar had no idea.
The snow blew so hard,
Gunnar could not see
his own hands.

But Balto had run this trail
many times before.
Now it was all up to him.

Finally the storm died down.
Gunnar saw Point Safety just ahead.
“Balto did it!” thought Gunnar.
He couldn’t wait to warm his hands
by a cozy fire.
But all the lights were out
at Point Safety.

Was the next driver there?
Gunnar did not know.
And there was no time to find out.
So Gunnar and Balto did not stop.
They had never been so tired.
But they raced on through the night
toward Nome.

It was just before dawn.
The sky began to glow.
In the town of Nome
everyone was sleeping.
Gunnar and his team pulled into town.
They had made it!

Balto was too tired to bark.
They had been on the trail
for 20 hours straight.
They had driven 53 miles!

Gunnar took the medicine to the doctor.
The doctor was surprised.
He thought it would take 15 days
to get the medicine.
But Gunnar delivered it
after only five and a half days!

“Thank you, Gunnar!” said the doctor.
“You are a hero!”
“Balto is the hero,” said Gunnar.
“I could not have done it without him.”

The doctor went right to work.
He gave the medicine
to all the sick people.
In a few days they would be well.
The town of Nome was saved.
