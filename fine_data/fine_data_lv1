but theyre too big for me
when i wear my moms shoes
said sally i fall
her shoes are too big
and my feet are too small
shoe trouble the cat said
well i have some news
not everyones feet can
fit in the same shoes

and soon youll see that
some are flippy some flappy
and some feet are flat
want to see some neat feet
well today ill take you
to a faraway place
bingbunglebaboo
its a wonderful place
full of friends you will meet
and each of them has
oh such different feet
in minutes they landed
in bingbunglebaboo
right by a lake
and the cat called yoohoo
hello there cat welcome
to my lake said a duck
emily cried the cat
there you are were in luck

my friends said the cat
as you see her two feet
are all flippy and flat
its true said the duck
my feet are long and wide
lets swim and ill race you
to the other side
the kids tried their best
but soon sally said
weve fallen behind
emilys way ahead
she won said the cat
and we came in last
her feet push the water
so she can swim fast
duck feet are perfect
for swimming its true
with my flippermazippers
we can swim fast too
they swam really fast
and crossed the finish line
then they heard a voice call
do you have feet like mine
nick and sally the cat said
id like you to meet
mikey the lemur
who hangs by his feet
our feet arent like yours
said nick not at all
if we hung by our feet
im afraid we would fall
i have lemur feet
said the cat just for you
now you can hang
the way mikey can do
before the kids knew it
they were up in a tree
i can hang like a lemur
said nick look at me

you will think that its neat
you can hang upside down
just by using your feet
lemurs are great climbers
a voice said but see
nobody is better
at climbing than me
greg the gecko the cat said
were glad to see you
geckos have feet
that can stick just like glue
tiny hairs said greg

these hairs let me hold on
so i do not slip
the cat passed out gecko feet
nick said this is tricky
i cant move at all
my feet are too sticky
look said the gecko
ill show you my trick
press and peel peel and press
and your feet will not stick
they pressed and they peeled
and the gecko was right
they walked upside down
and their feet held on tight
i can walk like a gecko
said nick who would guess
you can walk upside down
if you peel and you press
try duck feet for swimming
and lemurs for gripping
the feet of a gecko
will keep you from slipping
but sally i think that
when we get back home
ill return your dads shoes
and just wear
my own
squeak squeak
is that the sound
of a baby dinosaur
calling to its mother
nobody knows
nobody has ever heard
a baby dinosaur
nobody has seen one
the age of the dinosaurs
ended millions of years ago
but we know a lot
about them from what
dinosaur hunters have
found
they have found small
baby bones in nests
they have even found
dinosaur eggs
many dinosaurs were very big
but their eggs were small
the smallest was only
as big as a quarter
the biggest was about
the size of a football
were dinosaurs good mothers
this kind of dinosaur was
she made a nest of mud
and laid her eggs in it
chickens sit on their eggs
but this dinosaur did not
she was too heavy
the eggs would break
she put leaves on the eggs
to keep them warm
the mother watched the nest
lots of animals liked to eat
dinosaur eggs
she kept them away
inside the eggs
the babies grew
they breathed through
tiny holes in the eggshells
one day the eggs cracked
little baby dinosaurs came out
they were hungry
maybe they squeaked
the mother dinosaur
brought them food
the babies ate and ate
all day long
dinosaur babies
had big heads and big eyes
they could see and hear well
tyrannosaurustieranuhsorus
human babies are born
without any teeth
not dinosaur babies
they had lots of teeth
apatosaurusuhpatuhsorus
what did baby dinosaurs eat
some kinds ate leaves and
berries and seeds
deinonychusdienonihkus
some kinds ate little animals
and bugs
ornithomimusornihthuhmymus
was it safe for baby dinosaurs
to hunt for food alone no
tyrannosaurustieranuhsorus
enemies were all around
and baby dinosaurs could not
fight or run fast
they could only hide
some baby dinosaurs
were lucky
they were never alone
they lived in herds
even then enemies
tried to grab
the babies and eat them
maybe the big dinosaurs
made a circle
and kept the little ones inside
babies were safe
in the dinosaur herd
the dinosaurs walked and ate
and slept together
baby dinosaurs kept growing
and changing
some kinds grew sharp horns
stegosaurus
some kinds grew spikes
on their tails
protoceratops
others grew bony frills
brachiosaurus
they grew until
they werent babies
anymore
some grew to be the
biggest animals ever
to walk the earth
and some had
dinosaur babies
of their own
it is a sunny day
on the island of sodor
thomas is working
in the clay pits
thomas sees
giant footprints
in the rock
the footprints
are scary
what made them
thomas tells percy
what he saw
percy thinks a monster
made the prints
he is scared
the next day
percy goes
back to work
he sees a dark shadow
up ahead
is it a monster
no
it is a new engine
named gator
percy and gator
are friends now
but percy is still
scared of monsters
gator tells percy
to be brave
even if he is scared
a big ship
is leaving sodor
percy wants to go too
gator says
running away
is not very brave
thomas wants
percy to stay
he sees the ship
pull cranky pull
the boat stops
just in time
but percy is not
on the boat
he has gone back
to the clay pits
he wants to see
the footprints
percy chuffs
up the mountain
the ground shakes
rocks fall down
something big
falls near percy
he is sure
it is a monster
but it is not a monster
it is a dinosaur fossil
percy has made
a really useful
discovery
the footprints were
made a long time ago
percy solved
the monster mystery

a tunnel
in the mud
then she gathers
grass and leaves
from the riverbank
she is making a nest
the platypus lays
two eggs in the nest
they are about
the size of gumballs
she snuggles the eggs
between her tail
and belly
shhhh

is taking a nap
she sleeps during
the day
uhoh
the platypus wakes up
she hears a noise
a snake is
in her tunnel
it wants to
eat her eggs
ssss
the snake hisses
grrrr
the platypus growls
are they going to fight
no
the platypus
scares off the snake
it slithers away
to find food
somewhere else
the platypus eggs
are safe for now
the eggs hatch
in about two weeks
the tiny platypus babies
drink their moms milk
they stay in the tunnel
for four months
until they are bigger
now it is summer
the babies
follow their mother
out of the tunnel
they are hungry
but they cannot
find food until
they learn to swim
the platypus mom shows
her babies how to swim
her front feet push
through the water
she steers with her
back feet and tail
then they learn
how to get food
they use their bills
like big spoons
swoosh
the platypus babies
are good swimmers now
they zip and zoom
all night long
